To start you on your journey I want to give you a brief overview of what C# and .NET are, and what tools you will need to get going. 

## What is .NET? 
.NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications. This platform is used by companies of all different industries and different sizes. If you’ve ever used Stack Overflow, eaten Chipotle, or received a package delivered by UPS, then you’ve interacted with .NET! 

With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, IoT, and more!
