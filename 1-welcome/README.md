## What is .NET? 
.NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications. This platform is used by companies of all different industries and different sizes. If you‚Äôve ever used Stack Overflow, eaten Chipotle, or received a package delivered by UPS, then you‚Äôve interacted with .NET! 

With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, IoT, and more!
